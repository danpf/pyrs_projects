# Striped Smith-Waterman implementation in Rust with python bindings -- dpf-ssw-aligner-rs
This project was my first look into rust, how rust interacts with pyo3, and with SIMD programming.

[Rust Library](src/rust/dpf-ssw-aligner-rs)
[Python Library](src/python/dpf-ssw-aligner-rs)

I was especially impressed with the seamless integration between rust and python via pyo3, especially after many
years of fighting with pybind11.
